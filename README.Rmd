[SpatialEpiApp](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SpatialEpiApp) runs a Shiny web application that allows to visualize spatial and spatio-temporal disease data, estimate disease risk and detect clusters.

The application allows to fit Bayesian disease models to obtain risk estimates and their uncertainty by using the [R-INLA](http://www.r-inla.org), and to detect clusters by using the scan statistics implemented in [SaTScan](https://www.satscan.org). The application allows user interaction and creates interactive visualizations such as maps supporting padding and zooming and tables that allow for filtering. It also enables the generation of reports containing the analyses performed.

Data for running examples are in http://Paula-Moraga.github.io/software
